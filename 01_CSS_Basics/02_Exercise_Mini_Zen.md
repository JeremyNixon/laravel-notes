[CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/)

In the spirit of the CSS Zen Garden, let's create our own little mini zen.
Take the following HTML and add your own style to it with CSS.

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
	
		<title>My Mini Zen</title>
		
	</head>
	<body>
	
		<h1>My Mini Zen</h1>
		
		<p>This page is a demonstration of what can be accomplished visually through CSS-based design.</p>
		
		<h2>CSS Zen Garden Facts</h2>
		<ul>
			 <li>The CSS Zen garden was created in 2003.</li>
			 <li>When the site launched, it contained only five designs.</li>
			 <li>In 2005, a book version of the site was published.</li>
			 <li>In May of 2013, for the tenth anniversary of the site, the Zen Garden was redesigned and opened again for submissions.</li>
		</ul>

[Example...](http://codepen.io/wcc/pen/nACoE?editors=110)

You must use these properties:

* font-family
* color
* background-color
* font-size
* line-height

You should aim to use at least three other properties of your choice (but you're welcome to use more).

You can use internal or external CSS.

You can edit the HTML only to add class / ids and add your internal or external CSS code.
 
Don't stress out about making your example a beautiful work of art; the main point right now is just to get some practice applying these styles.
