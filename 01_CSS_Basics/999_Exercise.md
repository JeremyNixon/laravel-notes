### Specifications:

* Use an external style sheet.
* Background pattern image: <http://misc001.s3.amazonaws.com/cross-cross-pattern.png>
* You don't have match the exact width, height, font sizes or shades of color; just try to get as close as you can.
* Think about using the element for the job. For example, if you have a large heading, an h1 tag would be more spot-on than a generic div tag.
* This exercise is designed to get you digging through the [CSS reference list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference); you'll want to look into some properties we haven't covered yet such as margin, padding and styling links.
