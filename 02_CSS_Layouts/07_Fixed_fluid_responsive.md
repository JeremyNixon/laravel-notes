## Fixed
With fixed layouts, you're mostly dealing with set widths. This means that no matter how big or small your user's screen or browser is, the design is going to stay the same.

Note: Fixed layouts != position:fixed. Fixed layouts and fixed position are actually quite different beasts. Don't let the regrettably confusing terminology get you muddled.

## Fluid
Fluid (aka liquid) layouts are flexible; they expand and contract with the browser window. Here are some common characteristics you'll see with fluid designs:

Type will wrap differently depending on the browser width.

Blank space (aka <em>white space</em>) between items can expand and contract.

The site seems to "fill" the browser no matter how big it is.

## Responsive

* [Media Queries](http://mediaqueri.es/) (Gallery of examples)

Not only does the site resize, it rearranges for optimal use of the space.
