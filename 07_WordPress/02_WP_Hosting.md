Most shared web hosting providers should run WordPress without any problem.

<http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/>

Requirements:

* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

If in doubt, ask:

	I'm interested in running the open-source WordPress <http://wordpress.org/> blogging software 
	and I was wondering if my account supported the following:
	
	PHP 5.2.4 or greater
	MySQL 5.0 or greater
	The mod_rewrite Apache module
	
	Thanks!
