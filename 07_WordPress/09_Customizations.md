## To Do: Set up pages and menu

Create pages via *Pages :: Add New*

2. Portfolio
3. Contact
4. Blog

Organize the menu via *Appearance :: Menu*

* Order: *Portfolio, Contact, Blog, Home*
* Remove *Home* and *Sample Page* from the menu.
* Click *Create Menu* and set it to be the *Primary Menu*

## Customize Theme
* Clear out widgets for minimal look ala *Appearance :: Widgets*
* Upload a header via *Appearance :: Header* <http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-graphics-by-liz-header.png>
* Uncheck *Show header text with your image.*
* Set background color to white via *Appearance :: Background*




## Reading Settings
Right now when you land on the site it shows recent blog posts, which doesn't match the goal of our project. 

In *Settings :: Reading* change the Front page display to *A static page*

Make the Front page set to *Home*

And the Posts page set to *Blog*

## What's next?
We've maxed out the theme's customziations. If you wanted to customize further, you'd have to hit the code.

You can see the code via *Appearance :: Editor* but it's not suggested you make edits here because if you ever needed to update your theme you'd lose all your work.

Instead, you'd want to create a Child Theme. You can read more about that here: <http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes>
